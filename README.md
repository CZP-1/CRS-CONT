# CRS-CONT

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our IEEE TIP 2022 paper:

> **CRS-CONT: A Well-Trained General Encoder for Facial Expression Analysis**      
> Hangyu Li, Nannan Wang*, Xi Yang, Xinbo Gao        
> *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (IEEE TIP), 2022*

*Codes and the encoder will be released soon!*

## Requirements

We test the codes in the following environments, other versions may also be compatible:

- Python==3.6.9
- PyTorch==1.3.0
- Torchvision==0.4.1
